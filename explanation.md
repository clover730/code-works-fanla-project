We made a circuit that tells the tempter and tells and alerts you if it gets out of the optimal range.
We made it so that if the tempter is 75 or below the light would turn blue, the buzzer would make a noise, and the screen would say "COLD".
We also made it so if the tempter is 80 or more the light would turn red, the buzzer would make a diffent noise, and the screen would say "HOT".
If the tempter is between 75 and 80 the light would be white, the buzzer would turn off, and the screen would say "NORMAL".
